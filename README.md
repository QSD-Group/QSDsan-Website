## Installation

If you don't have `npm` (what are [npm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Npm_(software)), [Node.js](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node.js), [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#intro)?), follow the [official instructions](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).


Once you have `npm`, install all required packages (the `--force` flag to override `lottie` and use React 17).

```bash
npm install --force
```

Then, start the website using

```bash
npm start
```
